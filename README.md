# Human-Activity-Recognition

Human activity recognition, or HAR for short, is the problem of using sensors to predict what a person is doing based on a person's motion trajectory. These actions are usually normal indoor activities such as standing, sitting, jumping, and climbing stairs. Sensors are usually located on objects, such as smartphones or vests, and they usually record accelerometer data in three dimensions (x, y, z), gyroscope, magnetometer and gps of the phone.
